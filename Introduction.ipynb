The features includes better school and median housing price according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both fresh and waste water and faeces conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n",

        "### **About the location**\n",
        "Scarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship.

        "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Work Flow**\n",
        "Using credentials of Foursquare API features of near-by places of the neighborhoods would be mined. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Approach used- Clustering Neighborhoods**\n",
        "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",

        "### **Libraries used in the Project**\n",
        "* Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes\n",
        "* Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map\n",
        "* Sklearn Learn: For importing k-means clustering\n",
